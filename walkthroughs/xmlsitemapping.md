# XML Sitemapping key points

* The sitemap should be added as a .xml file to the root directory of your project (i.e., the directory that contains your index.html file)

* Take a look at the example in the EdStem content to see the format you should use for your xml file.

* Remember to validate your xml using the tool [here](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/validate-xml-sitemap.html). This makes sure that you don't have any errors in your formatting.

* After you've added and pushed your sitemap.xml file, use the [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) tool to add your site to Google's indexing system. 
    * Remember to select the "URL prefix" option, and to add the root address of your website, not the address of your sitemap.xml file.
    * Google will supply you with a verification file. Add that file to the project directory and push it to GitHub in order to prove you're the owner of the site!
