# Oliver-CoderAcademy.github.io

This was an example website that I created for students in a web-development class. As I was demonstrating, I also used the opportunity to share information and resources related to the course. Some of the code is quick-and-dirty because it was created live on stream do demonstrate concepts in HTML and CSS.
